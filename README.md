# FinalProject-DataScience2024
Final Project Repo for Into to Data Science for Public Policy - May 2024 

## Summary

This final project was initially motivated by the question of how race/ethnicity affects university access in South America. In the process, we turned to a general analysis of socioeconomic determinants of going to university. We use exploratory data analysis techniques to enhance our understanding of general socioeconomic indicators in the region, with a particular focus on university/education attainment. We then present a study case for Argentina, where we apply unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to answer our research question. In this case, we find that the most relevant variables in determining access to university are age, income, access to a formal job, household, and skin color. We conclude by suggesting future lines of research and a summary of the technical details we learned about the data during the process.

## Section 1 - Literature Review

This section summarize key researches that describe how ethnic background and inequality impede access to higher 
education and educational outcomes. It includes researches completed in Argentina and Brazil.

## Section 2 - Data Sources

This section includes the links and details of our data sources including how to access them, and basic description 
of how it was synthesized.

## Section 3 - Data Wrangling

This section includes code chunks for cleaning the data for subsequent analysis along with describing each step.

## Section 4 - Exploratory Analysis

This section uses the cleaned data to create visuals describing our data looks like with the major focus being 
higher education which is our independant variable in all analysis.

## Section 5 - Data Analysis

This section includes all of the analysis we have conducted to answer our research question. We used different machine
learning methods such as unsupervised machine learning, supervised machine learning, probit classification, decision tree
 and random forest classification to predict the role of different factors in higher eductaional attainment.
We also analyse the models' performance and use the best model according to our defined parameters on a testing subset
of data to predict our independant variable.

## Section 6 - Discussion of Results

This section summarizes our key findings from section 5 and its usefullness in further analysis / policy design.
